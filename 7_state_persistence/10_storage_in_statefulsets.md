# Storage in Stateful Sets

## Overview

Storage works a little differently than in regular deployments when working with Stateful Sets...

With stateful set storage, unless you want your pods to share one singular storage volume and instead want each pod to have its own local storage, then what you want to do is use your stateful set to create the PVs and PVCs automatically for each pod...

How do you do that?

Essentially, all you do differently is take what your would normally configure in a regular PVC a file and add it into your stateful set configuration file under 'volumeClaimTemplates:'...

And as it this field is an array, you can configure multiple of these PVC templates below it and within your stateful set config file...

After doing this, once your stateful set is created, as it creates each pod for you then it will also create dedicated storage along with each... Along with the PVs and PVCs...
